module Worker
  # The Postal Worker process is responsible for handling all background tasks. This includes processing of all
  # messages, webhooks and other administrative tasks. There are two main types of background work which is completed,
  # jobs and scheduled tasks.
  #
  # The 'Jobs' here allow for the continuous monitoring of a database table (or queue) and processing of any new items
  # which may appear in that. The polling takes place every 5 seconds by default and the work is able to run multiple
  # threads to look for and process this work.
  #
  # Scheduled Tasks allow for code to be executed on a ROUGH schedule. This is used for administrative tasks.  A single
  # thread will run within each worker process and attempt to acquire the 'tasks' role. If successful it will run all
  # tasks which are due to be run. The tasks are then scheduled to run again at a future time. Workers which are not
  # successful in acquiring the role will not run any tasks but will still attempt to acquire a lock in case the current
  # acquiree disappears.
  #
  # The worker process will run until it receives a TERM or INT signal. It will then attempt to gracefully shut down
  # after it has completed any outstanding jobs which are already inflight.
